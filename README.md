# U.S. Stereotypes Measured across Agency, Beliefs, and Communion

This repository contains the code and dataset from our paper [].

## Dataset
We conduct human study to collect human judegements on stereotypes towards 25 social groups within 5 domains, across all 16 pairs of traits from the ABC model. 
Please read the datasheet included in the `dataset` folder for details of the dataset.

## Word Association Test
To capture the group-trait associations in the masked LM, we assess two previously proposed word association tests and also propose a new measurement: the sensitivity test (SeT). All of the code are available in the `code` folder.
